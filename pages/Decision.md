tags:: flowElement

- 定义 #card
	- Evaluate a set of conditions, and route users through the flow based on the outcomes of those conditions. This element performs the equivalent of an if-then statement.
- 使用 Usage
	- When a flow executes a Decision element, it evaluates each decision outcome in order. For the first outcome whose conditions are met, the flow takes the associated path. If no outcome’s conditions are met, the flow takes the path for the default outcome. [[Default Outcome]]
- For each path that the flow can take, create an outcome. [[Decision Outcome]]
