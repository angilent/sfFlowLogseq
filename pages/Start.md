tags:: flowElement

- Connect the Start element to the flow element that you want to execute first at run time. In an autolaunched flow, you can open the Start element to add a trigger that launches the flow. Without a trigger, you must set up other things to invoke the autolaunched flow, such as custom buttons, processes, Apex classes, or Einstein Bots.
