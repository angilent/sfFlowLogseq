	- A flow interview is a running instance of a flow.
- 对 flow interviews 可以执行的操作 #card
	- [[Delete a Flow Interview]]
	- [[Pause a Flow Interview]]
	- [[Resume a Flow Interview]]
- When a user session expires, in-progress flow interviews are interrupted and can’t be resumed. If the flow executed actions, such as a Create Records or Post to Chatter element, those actions aren’t rolled back. But other progress through the interview, such as what the user entered on the screen, is lost. #flowLimit
	- [[user session expires]] 相关建议
		- Set your session timeout settings to log out users after an appropriate period of time.
		- Encourage your users to pay attention during interviews for alerts about their sessions expiring soon.
		- Remind users to avoid running flows during release upgrades. A typical upgrade takes about 5 minutes.
	- Paused or waiting flow interviews aren’t affected by expired user sessions.

- flow 使用建议 #学习提示
	- 可以使用浏览器的前进后退按钮吗？ #card
		- Don't use your browser's Back or Forward buttons to navigate through a flow. Doing so can result in inconsistent data between the flow and Salesforce.
	- Flow 可以有多个 version 吗？ #card
		- A single flow can have up to 50 different versions. When you run a flow, you see the active version, but your admin could have a more recent version. #flowLimit
